# BombSquad-Server
### This branch is for the file for BombSquad game's server to be created on Linux.

## Info
This branch of this repository contains the my modded files to create a BombSquad game's servers on linux Ubuntu distributions.

The files are updated regularly after every new release of the original BombSquad dedicated server for linux files by Mr. Eric Froemling.

## Installation
#### IMPORTANT: Before downloading my server files make sure you have the right version of python installed on your system
### Setting up
To use my modded BombSquad server scripts on linux, just download the latest release of this repository targeted to this branch.
Then extract the downloaded archive of the files into a folder, let's name that folder to `43201` in this example.
Do your necessary server config edits in the `bombsquad_server`, then open `data/scripts/mystats.py` and change all names and locations to the one which you prefer (bot_file is the file generated by the mystats.py to be read by my discord bot and make stats available to get in discord channels, you can turn it on or off in `data/scripts/settings.py`), then open `data/scripts/settings.py` and turn on or off any custom setting option; you may also do other edits you want, but at your risk.

(IMPORTANT) Cut and paste the files in the `html` folder to your web server root directory which you will use for your stats site to show, else the stats site won't work as expected.

### Launching
After you are ready to launch the server, cd into the directory using cd command, in this example: `cd 43201`; then:

If using for the first time, type the following commands:
- `chmod 777 bs_headless`
- `chmod 777 bombsquad_server`
- `chmod 777 config.py`

Else or after using those three commands, use the following two commands:
  1) `tmux`
  2) `./bombsquad_server`

And done, your server will be online and available to join, if you encounter any problem, you may create an issue in this repository.
